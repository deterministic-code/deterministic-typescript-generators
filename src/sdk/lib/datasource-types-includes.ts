/**
 * Recursively resolve a datasource_types document's `includes:` by folding each
 * included config in as the combine `source` (its types prepended) and the
 * current accumulator as the `destination`. Includes are folded in reverse so
 * that, in the merged output, earlier-listed includes appear before later ones,
 * and the including config's own types come last.
 *
 * `load(include, ctx)` is injected — it returns `{ text, key, ctx, customMigrations }`
 * for the referenced config (file read, HTTP, DB, …). `key` identifies the target
 * for cycle detection; the returned `ctx` is passed to the nested resolution so
 * relative paths rebase correctly; `customMigrations` (a `{ [dialect]: [pairs] }`
 * map, optional) carries that datasource's hand-authored `custom/` SQL so
 * `skip_migrations` entities keep their DDL across the include. Seed `ctx.visited`
 * to catch cycles back to the root. Pure aside from the injected loader; combine
 * collisions / invalid references throw via `combineDatasourceTypes`.
